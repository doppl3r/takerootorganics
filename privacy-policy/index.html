The Privacy Policy covers both our “online” (e.g., web and mobile services, including any web sites operated by us and mobile applications, however accessed and/or used, whether via personal computers, mobile devices or otherwise) and “offline” (e.g., collection of data through mailings, telephone, or at in person events) activities owned, operated, provided, or made available by Green Thumb Grown Foods. Our “online” and “offline” activities are collectively referenced as the “Services.” This Privacy Policy also applies to your use of interactive features or downloads that: (i) we own or control; (ii) are available through the Sites; or (iii) interact with the Sites and post this Privacy Policy.</p>

We may collect this information through various forms and in various places through the Services, including account registration forms, contact us forms, or when you otherwise interact with us.</p>
                        <p>(B) INFORMATION WE COLLECT AS YOU ACCESS AND USE OUR SERVICES<br>In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the Services (“Usage Information”).

                        <h2>What is Online Behavioral Advertising and How Can I Opt-Out?</h2>
                        <p>We contract with third-party advertising networks, publishers and other entities to advertise our products and services on websites not affiliated with us. Some of these ads are online behavioral advertising – which serve advertisements that are more likely to be of interest to you using non-personal behavioral information. Such ads may contain cookies that allow monitoring of websites (including our own websites that are part of our own Services) and your response to our advertisements. Cookies placed by these companies do not collect Personal Information. We limit companies that place our ads from using information for any purpose other than to assist us in our advertising efforts.</p>
                        <p>From time to time our consumer products business may adopt the use of the Advertising Options Icon on behaviorally targeted ads. For any of our behaviorally targeted ads that are part of a “network advertising” service, you should see a small symbol Image removed.(also called an icon) attached to a banner ad or other targeted advertising that can be clicked open for information about why and how you are receiving a particular ad. This icon is part of the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. For more information see www.aboutads.info.</p>
                        <p>If you prefer to not receive targeted advertising, you can opt-out of some network advertising programs that use your information. To do so please visit the NAI Opt-Out Page.</p>
                        <p>Please note that if you opt out, you may still receive online advertising from us. Opting out from a specific advertising provider means that the ads you do receive will not be based on your preferences or behavior.</p>
                        <p>In order for behavioral advertising opt-outs to work on your device, your browser must be set to accept cookies. If you delete cookies, buy a new Device, access our Services from a different device, login under a different screen name, or change web browsers, you will need to opt-out again. If your browser has scripting disabled, you do not need to opt out, as online behavioral advertising technology does not work when scripting is disabled. Please check your browser's security settings to validate whether scripting is active or disabled.</p>
                        <p>Please note that even if you choose to remove your information (opt-out), you will still see advertisements while you're browsing online. However, the advertisements you see may be less relevant to you and your interests. Additionally, many network advertising programs allow you to view and manage the interest categories they have compiled from your online browsing activities. These interest categories help determine the types of targeted advertisements you may receive. The NAI Opt-Out Page provides a tool that identifies its member companies that have cookies on your browser and provides links to those companies.</p>
                        
                        <h2>What About Information I Disclose Publicly?</h2>

Others may have access to this User Content and may have the ability to share it with third parties across the Internet. Please think carefully before deciding what information you share, including Personal Information, in connection with your User Content. Please note that Green Thumb Grown Foods does not control who will have access to the information that you choose to make public, and cannot ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available information will respect your privacy or keep it secure.

                        <p>Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.</p>
                        <p>We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.</p>

                        <p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.
